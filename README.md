# CosmoQuest-Style-Guide
Need CosmoQuest Graphics or to know how to conform to our standard colors and styles and grammars? This is the place!

Initially, this repository will be tracking the process of migrating the PDF version of the CosmoQuest Style Guide to its Github Wiki.

Once the migration is complete, it will serve as the evergreen and official Style Guide for all CosmoQuest collateral.

Future updates to the style guide will be tracked here and ultimately incorporated into the Wiki once approved by key stakeholders.
